#  2D Survival Game

**Survive ever-growing enemy hordes** in this intense 2D battlegroundâ€”a passion project developed with a touch of AI-powered insights to streamline code structure and squash bugs!  

##  What Makes This Game Cool?  
- **Dynamic Wave System**  
Enemy numbers crank up every waveâ€”what starts as a light skirmish quickly escalates into pure chaos!  

- **Smart Spawns, Smarter Foes**  
Enemies spawn unpredictably across the map, while their AI makes them relentlessly chase you *and* dodge attacks. Pro tip: Keep moving!  

- **Weapons That Feel Right**  
Slash precisely with the improved rotating sword or pick off enemies from afar with ranged attacksâ€”all built on code that treats every weapon as a "damage dealer" 

- **Camera That Keeps Up**  
No losing track of the actionâ€”the camera smoothly follows your every move.  

##  Behind the Scenes  
Built with **SOLID principles** for code that's as maintainable as it is functional:  
- **`WeaponManager`**: The brain behind attacksâ€”whether itâ€™s a sword swing or bullet, enemies wonâ€™t know what hit them.  
- **`EnemyAI`**: All baddies share the same `IDamageable` interface, making combat logic clean and consistent.  
- **`WaveManager`**: Handles enemy spawns and difficulty scaling like a pro.  

## ðŸš€ Quick Start  
1. Clone the repo and dive straight into Unity.  
2. Assign prefabs/spawn points via the inspector (hint: Iâ€™ve commented the code for clarity!).  
3. Hit **Play**â€”your survival instincts will thank you.

**Credits**: Built with Unity 2022 and occasional AI-assisted code structuring. 

**ðŸ‘‰ Pro Tip**: The swordâ€™s rotation logic went through 12 iterationsâ€”check out `SwordAttack.cs` to see how AI helped optimize the angle calculations!
